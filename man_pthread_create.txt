PTHREAD_CREATE(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	     PTHREAD_CREATE(3)

NAME
     pthread_create -- create a new thread

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
	 void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_create() function is used to create a new thread, with
     attributes specified by attr, within a process.  If attr is NULL, the
     default attributes are used.  If the attributes specified by attr are
     modified later, the thread's attributes are not affected.	Upon success-
     ful completion pthread_create() will store the ID of the created thread
     in the location specified by thread.

     The thread is created executing start_routine with arg as its sole argu-
     ment.  If the start_routine returns, the effect is as if there was an
     implicit call to pthread_exit() using the return value of start_routine
     as the exit status.  Note that the thread in which main() was originally
     invoked differs from this.  When it returns from main(), the effect is as
     if there was an implicit call to exit() using the return value of main()
     as the exit status.

     Upon thread exit the storage for the thread must be reclaimed by another
     thread via a call to pthread_join().  Alternatively, pthread_detach() may
     be called on the thread to indicate that the system may automatically
     reclaim the thread storage upon exit.  The pthread_attr_setdetachstate()
     function may be used on the attr argument passed to pthread_create() in
     order to achieve the same effect as a call to pthread_detach() on the
     newly created thread.

     The signal state of the new thread is initialized as:

	   o   The signal mask is inherited from the creating thread.

	   o   The set of signals pending for the new thread is empty.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_create() function will return zero.  Otherwise
     an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_create() function will fail if:

     [EAGAIN]		The system lacked the necessary resources to create
			another thread, or the system-imposed limit on the
			total number of threads in a process
			[PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX] would be exceeded.

     [EPERM]		The caller does not have appropriate permission to set
			the required scheduling parameters or scheduling pol-
			icy.

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.

STANDARDS
     The pthread_create() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (``POSIX.1'').
